# Secure-File-Encryption-Tool
The Secure File Encryption Tool is a user-friendly application designed to protect sensitive files by encrypting and decrypting them using the AES-256 encryption algorithm, Built with Python and Tkinter.

# Key Features
âœ… AES-256 Encryption â€“ Ensures strong security for files using CBC mode.
âœ… File Integrity Protection â€“ Prevents unauthorized modifications.
âœ… Password-Based Encryption â€“ Uses PBKDF2 key derivation to strengthen security.
âœ… Graphical User Interface (GUI) â€“ Built with Tkinter, making encryption accessible to all users.
âœ… Progress Bar & Status Messages â€“ Provides real-time updates during encryption & decryption.
âœ… Secure File Browsing â€“ Allows users to easily select files for processing.
âœ… Standalone Executable â€“ Can be converted into a .exe file for easy distribution.

# How It Works:
User selects a file through the Browse button.
User enters a password for encryption/decryption.
Click "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" to process the file.
Progress bar updates in real-time, and a success/error message is displayed.
For encryption, an .enc file is generated.
For decryption, the original file is restored.
This project is ideal for individuals who need a lightweight but secure tool to protect their sensitive files. ðŸš€ðŸ”’
